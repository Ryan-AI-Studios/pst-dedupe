# Deferred items (Dedupe)

Track-scoped findings and intentional product deferrals that are **not** blocking
completion, but must not be lost. Update when fixed or when a track owns the work.

## From track 0016-PurviewIngest (Codex / internal review)

| ID | Severity | Item | Notes | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-0016-01 | P3 | Nested zip open may re-increment `nested_zips` counter on resume | Telemetry only; expand correctness OK | future polish |
| D-0016-02 | P3 | ZIP general-purpose bit 11 approximated (not always read from raw flags) | Documented in `ingest-purview` README; encoding fallbacks still preserve names | future polish |
| D-0016-03 | P3 | No unique index on `items(source_id, path)` | App-level skip for resume; schema v1 kept | 0017+ if needed |
| D-0016-04 | — | Streaming multi-GB single entry without full buffer | Buffer cap only in 0016 | later performance |
| D-0016-05 | — | 7z expand | Explicit `unsupported_7z` only | future track |
| D-0016-06 | — | PST message extract | Discover/register only | **0018** |
| D-0016-07 | — | Full Normalized Item model | Minimal inventory only | **0017** |
| D-0016-08 | — | Blocking worker pool / process runner | Caller contract documented | **0019** |
| D-0016-09 | — | CLI `ingest` smoke subcommand | Optional nice-to-have | future |

## Hygiene

- When closing a deferred row, move it to a short “Fixed” note in the track `review.md` or delete the row.
- Do not park DoD-blocking P0–P2 items here.
